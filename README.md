# BudgetTracker

# Description

For our week 19 assignment, we had to add functionality to our existing Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality.

Name: Progressive Budget Tracker

As a user, we want them to be able to track withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection

The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.
